## INTRODUCTION

 Windscreen wiper is a device that cleans water, snow or mud from the windscreen of vehicle. Thus, it ensures proper visibility of the road ahead.  This system finds application on a large variety of locomotives from vehicles, railways to aero-planes. Generally, the term ‘windscreen wiper’ refers to the wipers installed on the front windshield of a vehicle. However, nowadays, rear wipers are also getting popular.
 Almost all the modern wiper mechanisms employ an electric motor for their operation. However, in some cases, pneumatic drives are also used to drive wiper arm. Some of the primitive designs of the wiper mechanism were hand operated. Rain sensing wipers is a recent development in wipers.

 Wiper mechanism comprises of the following major components:
* Wiper motor: 
It drives the linkages of wiper mechanism which ultimately makes the wiper blade to move on the windscreen.
* Linkage: 
Linkage performs two major functions. Firstly, it holds the wiper arm and blade in position and maintains proper contact between the blade and the windscreen. Secondly, it converts the rotary motion obtained from the motor into suitable form. And to do this, it employs a worm gear. Worm gear reduces the speed of output shaft of motor and converts it into suitable torque required to operate wiper arm.
* Wiper arm: 
Wiper arm is the connecting link between wiper linkage and wiper blade.
* Wiper blade: 
 Blade is a rubber part that comes in contact with glass. It also has a metal clamping attached to it which aids in maintaining uniform pressure on the blade.

### SPEED MODES
Most wipers have a low and a high speed, as well as an intermittent setting. When the wipers are on low and high speed, the motor runs continuously. But in the intermittent setting, the wipers stop momentarily between each wipe. There are many different kinds of switches for wipers. Some cars have just one intermittent speed, others have 10 discrete settings and still others have a sliding scale that can be set for almost any time interval.

The wipers combine two mechanical technologies to perform their task:

A combination electric motor and worm gear reduction provides power to the wipers.
A neat linkage converts the rotational output of the motor into the back-and-forth motion of the wipers.

## RECENT DEVELOPMENT

### Rain sensing wiper


In the past, automakers have tried to either eliminate the wipers or to control their speed automatically. Some of the schemes involved detecting the vibrations caused by individual raindrops hitting the windshield, applying special coatings that did not allow drops to form, or even ultrasonically vibrating the windshield to break up the droplets so they don't need to be wiped at all. But these systems were plagued by problems and either never made it to production or were quickly axed because they annoyed more drivers than they pleased.

However, a new type of wiper system is starting to appear on cars that actually does a good job of detecting the amount of water on the windshield and controlling the wipers. One such system is made by TRW Inc., here is a PDF describing their rain sensor system. TRW Inc. uses optical sensors to detect the moisture. The sensor is mounted in contact with the inside of the windshield, near the rearview mirror.

The sensor projects infrared light into the windshield at a 45-degree angle. If the glass is dry, most of this light is reflected back into the sensor by the front of the windshield. If water droplets are on the glass, they reflect the light in different directions -- the wetter the glass, the less light makes it back into the sensor.

The electronics and software in the sensor turn on the wipers when the amount of light reflected onto the sensor decreases to a preset level. The software sets the speed of the wipers based on how fast the moisture builds up between wipes. It can operate the wipers at any speed. The system adjusts the speed as often as necessary to match with the rate of moisture accumulation.

The TRW system, which is found on many General Motors cars, including all Cadillac models, can also be overridden or turned off so the car can be washed.
